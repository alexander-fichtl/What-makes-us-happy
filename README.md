# What-makes-us-happy - THINK. MAKE. START. application
This is my final class project for the UCLA "Data Science" course. It is one of my smaller projects, but one that I am really proud of! I am aware that this is likely not your typical THINK. MAKE. START. application. However, I was free to choose the topic, and I think the project reflects a lot of my personality and interests. Moreover, the project was featured as "best of class" at UCLA and shows how to convincingly tell a entertaining story about data - which comes in handy when applied to projects in the business world!

- **"Data Story Final_Alexander Fichtl.pdf"** is the upload of my class projects data story and the main document you should look at.

- **"main.R"**	the single R script including all my R code for the project.

- **"what_makes_us_happy.ipynb"** the jupyter-notebook containing some python code for things I really wanted to do but did not have the experience in R. I always tried it in R-Studio first, if I had to give up adn switch to python, I indicated this in the R script via a comment.

- **"responses.csv"**	is the csv file containing all the data.

- **"columns.csv"**	is a csv file containing explanations of every variable of the dataset.


### All the best to my future peers, I am looking forward to working with you!
